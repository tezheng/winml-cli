## :clipboard: Prerequisites

### Required Software

| **Component** | **How to Get It** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Windows 11** (x64 or ARM64) | Windows 11 24H2+ required for NPU support |
| **UV** | Install [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) |
| **Windows App SDK Runtime 1.8** | [Latest Windows App SDK downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads) |
| **ModelKit** (Python wheel) | Download [winml_modelkit-0.0.1.dev1-py3-none-any.whl](https://microsoft.sharepoint-df.com/:u:/r/teams/WinPD/Shared%20Documents/Forms/Gallery.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FWinPD%2FShared%20Documents%2FModelKit%2Fwinml%5Fmodelkit%2D0%2E0%2E1%2Edev1%2Dpy3%2Dnone%2Dany%2Ewhl&parent=%2Fteams%2FWinPD%2FShared%20Documents%2FModelKit&p=true&share=cQqnvDjbLu18QZ%5FhHSiX%2D2f3EgUCQzr1M%2DQKvecLbJEsxiAn7g) |

### Required Hardware

**ModelKit targets NPU.** We recommend testing on one of the following NPU devices:

| Device | EP | Flag |
|--------|-----|------|
| Snapdragon X Elite (Qualcomm) | QNN | `--ep qnn --device npu` |
| Intel AI Boost (Meteor Lake / Lunar Lake) | OpenVINO | `--ep openvino --device npu` |
| AMD Ryzen AI (Phoenix / Hawk Point / Strix) | VitisAI | `--ep vitisai --device npu` |

**No NPU?** Use `--device auto` — ModelKit will fall back to the best available device (GPU → CPU). Note that `winml compile` requires NPU and cannot run without one.

### Accepted Inputs

- **HuggingFace model ID** (e.g., `microsoft/resnet-50`) — weights are downloaded on first run
- **Local ONNX file** (e.g., `model.onnx`) — from `winml export`, `winml build`, or any ONNX you already have

### The Golden Rule: Inspect First

Before running any pipeline command, always verify the model is supported:

```bash
winml inspect -m <model-id>
```

If `inspect` prints an error or shows `Unsupported`, **skip that model**. Only models that pass inspect are valid inputs for export, analyze, build, perf, and eval.

---

## :package: Installation

ModelKit requires **Python 3.10** and is distributed as a Python wheel. We recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reproducible environment setup.

**1. Create a Python 3.10 environment**

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
```

Activate it:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Windows (Git Bash / WSL)
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

**2. Install from wheel**

```bash
uv pip install winml_modelkit-<version>-py3-none-any.whl
```

**3. Verify your environment**

```bash
winml sys --list-device --list-ep
```

Confirm that your target device and EP appear in the output:

- **Snapdragon X Elite** — look for `QNNExecutionProvider`
- **Intel AI Boost** — look for `OpenVINOExecutionProvider`
- **AMD Ryzen AI** — look for `VitisAIExecutionProvider`

If no NPU is detected, you can still use ModelKit with `--device auto` for most commands. The only exception is `winml compile`, which requires an NPU device.

<details>
<summary><strong>Primitives</strong> — one stage at a time</summary>

**`winml inspect`** — Discover model metadata. Prints the task, model class, input/output tensor names and shapes, and execution provider compatibility. No weights are loaded — this reads only the model configuration, making it fast and lightweight. Always run inspect first to verify a model is supported.

**`winml export`** — Convert a source model to ONNX. Takes a Hugging Face model ID (or local checkpoint) and produces a standards-compliant ONNX file with hierarchy-preserving metadata.

**`winml optimize`** — Fuse operators, simplify graphs, and prepare for target EPs. Takes an ONNX model and an optimization config (typically generated by `winml analyze`) and applies graph-level transformations: operator fusion, constant folding, shape inference, and EP-specific rewrites.

**`winml quantize`** — Compress to low-bit precision. Reduces model size and inference latency by converting weights and activations from FP32 to INT8 (or other low-bit formats). After quantization, the model is portable — it can run on any ONNX Runtime backend.

**`winml compile`** — Generate device-specific binaries. Takes a quantized ONNX model and produces EP-specific compiled artifacts (for example, QNN context binaries for Qualcomm NPU). This step locks the model to a specific device but delivers the lowest possible inference latency.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Pipeline</strong> — orchestrated workflows</summary>

**`winml config`** — Auto-detect optimal settings into a JSON config. Inspects the model and generates a complete build specification: task, I/O shapes, optimization flags, quantization parameters, and target EP settings. The config file is reviewable, editable, and version-controllable — the single source of truth for your build.

**`winml build`** — Orchestrate the full pipeline. Takes a config file and executes every stage in sequence: export, analyze, optimize, quantize, and compile. Two commands (`config` + `build`) replace eight manual steps.

**`winml perf`** — Benchmark latency, throughput, and hardware utilization. Runs inference on the target device and reports latency percentiles (p50, p90, p99), throughput (inferences per second), and optionally live hardware monitoring (CPU, RAM, NPU utilization) with the `--monitor` flag. Can accept a local ONNX file or a Hugging Face model ID.

**`winml eval`** — Measure model accuracy against reference datasets. Compares the output of your optimized/quantized model against the original to quantify any accuracy loss introduced by the pipeline.

**`winml run`** — End-to-end inference with pre/post processing. *(Coming soon.)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Insights</strong> — understand what is happening inside</summary>

**`winml analyze`** — Lint operators, check EP compatibility, and generate optimization config. The analyzer has two components: the **Linter** (like ESLint for ONNX) checks every operator against target EPs and classifies each as supported, partial, or unsupported. **AutoConf** detects suboptimal patterns and generates the optimization config that the optimizer consumes. Together they form the analyze-optimize loop.

**`winml debug`** — Interactive model debugging and layer-by-layer inspection. *(Coming soon.)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Utilities</strong> — catalog, cache, and environment</summary>

**`winml hub`** — Browse the curated built-in model catalog.

**`winml cache`** — Manage built model artifacts and pipeline outputs. View, clean, or selectively remove cached models and intermediate files.

**`winml doctor`** — Diagnose environment issues. Checks runtimes, execution providers, and dependencies to identify configuration problems.

**`winml setting`** — Configure ModelKit preferences. Set default EPs, output directories, and other global options.

**`winml sys`** — System information and capability reporting. Prints detected hardware, available EPs, Python version, and installed package versions.

## :rocket: Quick Start

### Inspect a Model

The fastest way to get started is to inspect a model. Let's look at ResNet-50:

```bash
winml inspect -m microsoft/resnet-50
```

This prints the model's metadata without downloading weights:

- **Task**: `image-classification` — what the model does
- **Model class**: `ResNetForImageClassification` — the architecture
- **Input tensors**: names, data types, and shapes (e.g., `pixel_values: float32 [1, 3, 224, 224]`)
- **Output tensors**: names, data types, and shapes (e.g., `logits: float32 [1, 1000]`)

If inspect succeeds, the model is supported and you can proceed with the rest of the pipeline.

> **Golden rule: always inspect first.** Before running export, build, perf, or any other pipeline command, verify the model is supported with `winml inspect`.

### Build with Primitive Commands

This walkthrough builds **ConvNeXT** (`facebook/convnext-base-224`) step by step using primitive commands. ConvNeXT is a family of CNN models inspired by Vision Transformers, introduced by Meta in 2022 — it offers high accuracy while retaining the efficiency of CNNs.

#### Phase 1: Inspect

```bash
winml inspect -m facebook/convnext-base-224
```

#### Phase 2: Build a Portable Model

**Export** from PyTorch to ONNX:

```bash
winml export -m facebook/convnext-base-224 -o convnext/model.onnx -v
```

**Analyze** for EP compatibility:

```bash
winml analyze -m convnext/model.onnx --optim-config optim.json
```

**Optimize** the graph using the analyzer's config:

```bash
winml optimize -m convnext/model.onnx -c optim.json -o convnext/model_opt.onnx
```

**Quantize** to INT8:

```bash
winml quantize -m convnext/model_opt.onnx -o convnext/model_opt_int8.onnx
```

#### Phase 3: Benchmark on Device

**Compile** for NPU (generates device-specific binaries):

```bash
winml compile -m convnext/model_opt_int8.onnx --ep qnn -o convnext/model_compiled.onnx
```

**Benchmark on NPU** — note the latency:

```bash
winml perf -m convnext/model_compiled.onnx --ep qnn --iterations 100
```

**Benchmark on CPU** for comparison:

```bash
winml perf -m convnext/model_opt.onnx --ep cpu --iterations 100
```

Compare the two numbers. You should see roughly a **25x speedup** — the quantized model on NPU versus the original on CPU. Same model, same accuracy, completely different performance.

### Build with Config + Build

Same model, different approach. Instead of running each command manually, use the config-driven pipeline. Think of it like CMake: `config` generates a build plan, `build` executes it.

**Generate the build config:**

```bash
winml config -m facebook/convnext-base-224 -o convnext_config.json
```

This creates a JSON file containing all settings for every pipeline step — task, I/O shapes, optimization flags, quantization parameters — all auto-detected from the model.

**Build the model:**

```bash
winml build -c convnext_config.json -m facebook/convnext-base-224 -o convnext_build/
```

This orchestrates the full pipeline — export, analyze, optimize, quantize, compile — all in one go. Same result as the manual steps above, but in two commands.

**Benchmark the result:**

```bash
winml perf -m convnext_build/model.onnx --ep qnn --iterations 100
```

The config file is the single source of truth for your build. Version-control it, share it with teammates, edit it to override settings, and replay builds deterministically on any machine.

### Benchmark in One Command

The simplest way to evaluate a model — one command, zero setup:

```bash
winml perf -m facebook/convnext-base-224 --device npu --monitor
```

ModelKit handles everything behind the scenes: download the model from Hugging Face, export to ONNX, optimize the graph, and run the benchmark on your NPU. The `--monitor` flag enables live hardware monitoring — real-time CPU utilization, RAM usage, and NPU activity alongside the latency results.

This is ideal for quick smoke tests: does the model run on this device, and how fast is it?

## :arrows_counterclockwise: The BYOM Workflow

The **Build Your Own Model** (BYOM) workflow is the philosophy behind ModelKit. It defines how a source model becomes a production-ready, device-optimized artifact.

### The Pipeline

```
Source Model --> Export --> Analyze --> Optimize --> Quantize --> Compile --> Benchmark
```

![BYOM Workflow](workflow-only.svg)

Each arrow is a ModelKit command. You can enter the pipeline at any stage (for example, start with a local ONNX file and skip export), exit early (stop after optimization if you do not need quantization), or loop back to repeat a stage with different settings.

## :warning: Scope & Limitations

### What ModelKit supports

ModelKit targets **classic deep learning models** — CNNs, encoders, vision transformers, NLP classifiers, token classifiers, object detection models, and segmentation models.

Supported tasks include:
- Image classification (ResNet, ViT, Swin, ConvNeXT)
- Text classification (BERT, RoBERTa)
- Token classification / NER (BERT, RoBERTa)
- Object detection (Table Transformer)
- Image segmentation (SegFormer)

### What ModelKit does not support

**LLMs and generative models are not in scope.** Do not use ModelKit with GPT, LLaMA, Phi, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, or any model with a decoder-only or sequence-to-sequence generative architecture. LLM support (with LoRA) is planned for Q3-Q4 2026.

### Known constraints

- `winml compile` requires an NPU device. If no NPU is available, skip the compile step and use `--device auto` for benchmarking.
- Some models may export successfully but fail during optimization or quantization due to unsupported operator patterns. The analyzer will flag these issues.
- Performance numbers vary by device, driver version, and EP version. Always benchmark on your target hardware.
