"""Unified execution-provider discovery.

This module replaces the legacy ``EP_PLUGIN_REGISTRY`` dict (which only
modeled PyPI-installed plugin EPs) with an ordered list of typed
``EPSource`` entries, analogous to the OS ``PATH`` environment variable.
Each entry knows how to resolve itself for the current machine and yields
:class:`EPEntry` records (``ep_name``, ``dll_path``, ``source``,
``status``, ``version``).

See ``docs/ep-path-design.md`` for the full design rationale, including
the per-origin x per-EP map and the migration plan.

Public API:

* :data:`EP_CATALOG`: canonical EP metadata registry (:class:`EPCatalog`).
* :class:`EPCatalog.Row`: frozen dataclass for one EP's metadata (name, DLL, vendor).
* :class:`EPCatalog`: registry with forward/inverse lookups and vendor compat.
* :class:`PyPISource`: pip-installed plugin EP wheels.
* :class:`NuGetSource`: NuGet-cached plugin EP packages
  (``~/.nuget/packages/<id>/<version>/runtimes/<rid>/native/...``).
* :class:`DirectorySource`: directory drops (installer, unzipped archive,
  custom build).
* :class:`WinMLCatalogSource`: WinAppSDK ``ExecutionProviderCatalog``
  MSIX-delivered EPs. Lazily imports the WinAppSDK ML Python binding;
  yields nothing silently when the binding is not installed.
* :class:`MSIXPackageSource`: WinRT ``PackageManager`` MSIX EP discovery
  by family-name prefix (handles non-current versions and the
  ``WindowsWorkload.EP.*`` OEM channel).
* :class:`EPSource`: abstract base for the five concrete sources.
* :func:`discover_all_eps`: walk the default EP source list (plus any
  extras) and return a flat ``list[EPEntry]`` containing the primary
  winner per EP followed by any shadowed entries. Single canonical
  discovery entry point — used by ``WinMLEPRegistry``, the inventory CLI
  (``winml sys --list-ep``), and the legacy ``winml.py`` shim.

    The 4th combination — a native-ARM64 process on genuine x64 hardware —
    isn't reachable: there is no Windows emulation path that runs an
    ARM64-only executable on x64 silicon, so it's intentionally omitted.

    Returns:
        ``"x64_native"``: x64 process, x64 host (no emulation involved).
        ``"x64_on_arm64"``: x64 process, ARM64 host (Windows-on-ARM x64
            emulation — the scenario this module's arch bug lived in).
        ``"arm64_native"``: native ARM64 process, ARM64 host.

    Host architecture (the piece that actually matters for this bug) comes
    from :class:`~winml.modelkit.sysinfo.CPU`'s ``architecture`` (WMI's
    ``Win32_Processor.Architecture``): it queries the physical processor
    inventory directly, not the calling process, so it's correct even
    under x64-on-ARM64 emulation — unlike ``platform.machine()``, which
    reports "AMD64" for an x64 Python venv on Windows-on-ARM64 even though
    the machine is ARM64. That's a documented ``onnxruntime-qnn`` footgun
    ("WoS AMD64 — Python 3.11 installer issue" in the v2.3.0 release
    notes): picking the amd64 (x64-emulated) QNN DLL over the native
    arm64ec one causes the QNN HTP EP to hang indefinitely on some SDK
    versions and run ~1000x slower on others, even though session creation
    succeeds either way.

    Process-own architecture uses ``platform.machine()`` directly — unlike
    host detection, it's correct for this: it only misreports the *host*
    under emulation, not itself.

    Cached (``lru_cache(maxsize=1)``): the host CPU cannot change within a
    process's lifetime, and this is called on every ``PyPISource.resolve()``
    with an ``arch_folder_map``; ``CPU.get_all()`` shells out to PowerShell
    per call, so repeating it per resolve would be wasteful. Tests that
    monkeypatch ``CPU.get_all``/``platform.machine`` to simulate different
    hosts must call ``_resolve_arch_key.cache_clear()`` first, or they'll
    observe a stale result from an earlier test.

    .NET SDK plus a project that has restored the package — the plugin
