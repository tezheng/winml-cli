        Returns the L0 discovery set — every EP with an EPEntry in
        :attr:`_discovered`. Built-in EPs (CPU/Dml/Azure) are synthesized
        into ``_discovered`` at ``__init__`` via :class:`BuiltinSource`,
        so they appear alongside filesystem-discovered plugin EPs in a
        single set.

        Three filters are deliberately NOT applied here:

        - **L1 (registration success)** — too expensive to gate a frequently
          called helper on DLL loads. :meth:`auto_device`'s retry loop owns
          L1 failure handling at session-build time.
        - **L2 (vendor-compatibility)** — kept out per
          ``docs/design/session/2_coreloop.md`` §7.1.1-§7.1.2: the
          ``--list-ep`` renderer needs an L0 set so it can distinguish a
          ``[failed]`` row (L1) from an ``[incompatible]`` row (L2). Baking
          L2 here would collapse those layers. Deduction helpers that need
          L2 (:func:`default_ep_for_device`, :func:`auto_detect_device`)
          compose ``EPCatalog.is_compatible`` on top — see
          ``docs/design/session/3_design_ep.md`` §6.4 for the composition
          pattern.
