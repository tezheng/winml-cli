"""D3D12 adapters on this machine, and the patterns their drivers declare.

Two questions get asked on every new machine and after every driver update: which
adapters are here, and what does this driver's MLIR-program implementation claim it
can match. Both answers come from public Windows APIs through ``ctypes``, so nothing
has to be built and no extra package has to be installed.

It does need one thing: an Agility SDK ``D3D12Core.dll`` of SDK version 720 or newer.
The MLIR-program feature is a preview feature and the inbox D3D12 runtime does not
serve it. Which redist answered opens every run on the ``redist:`` line, because the
same driver reports different things through the 720 and 721 exchange shapes; if none
can be found the failure names every place that was searched.

Columns:
    IDX         selection index, as accepted by ``-a``
    ADAPTER     DXCore DriverDescription
    DRIVER      DXCore DriverVersion, the four 16-bit parts
    TYPE        hardware, integrated or software
    ATTRIBUTES  the DXCore attributes the adapter advertises: ML, CC, GFX
    MLIR        whether the driver implements the MLIR-program exchange; ``?`` when no
                Agility SDK redist was found, since the question cannot be asked

Counts are reported as ``N patterns / M rules``. A pattern is one
``cgc_pattern.pattern`` declaration; a rule is one flat match alternative after
``any_of`` expansion. The two differ, and comparing declaration counts alone across
drivers can read a loss where the matching surface actually grew.
